description=[h1]Immersive Medicine - extension of default medicine[/h1]
description=
description=Are you tired of the same type of meds?
description=Are you surprised that in this world, all treatment consists of taking antidepressants and painkillers?
description=
description=I think I've found a solution for you. Meet: [b]Immersive Medicine[/b]

description=[h1]Blood transfusion system[/h1]
description=Do you think it's enough to monitor the character's default health? You're wrong.

description=[list]
description=[*]Slight blood loss: slight fatigue and drowsiness;
description=[*]Moderate blood loss: cold sweat, thirst;
description=[*]Critical blood loss: blurred vision, feeling cold;
description=[*]Fatal blood loss: complete exhaustion - don't forget to bring an obol with you
description=[/list]
description=
description=Does the last point sound scary? Put the white slippers aside! Either stock up on blood packs of your group in advance, or ask your friend. Just be careful: suddenly he is infected or his group simply does not suit you.
description=
description=Becoming a donor is easy. You need: a blood testing kit, an empty blood bag, a catheter for intravenous transfusion. And a refrigerator. If you overdo it and you need to store a friend or blood bags somewhere.
description=[i]To perform a blood transfusion, you need to select either the right or left forearm in the health panel[/i]
description=

description=
description=Morphine, naloxone... It sounds simple: take a syringe, stick a needle and let it run through the veins, what will come to mind? What if there are no syringes and needles in stock?
